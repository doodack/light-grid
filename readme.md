Light Grid [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaldudak/light-grid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaldudak/light-grid)
==========

## Overview
Simple, customizable grid component for Angular JS. See the [docs](http://light-grid.net/api) and
[samples](http://light-grid.net/demos) for details of the API.

## Building from source
Just run `grunt build` and look for the output file in the dist directory.

## Running tests
Type in `grunt test`, sit back and enjoy. This will check code style, run JSHint, build the project and run all the tests.

To continuously run code checks and tests, execute `grunt sanity-check`.

## Contributing
Pull requests are more than welcome! However, the new code must pass the quality checks and all tests.
The best way to ensure it is to run `grunt sanity-check` continously during development. For one-time check
run `grunt test`.
